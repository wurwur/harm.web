    We have identified some sort of sanitization of the query.
    We were able to identify:
        - Most common operators that were deleted
        - The fact that the sanitization process does not run recursively

    --------------------------------------------------

    This tampering script:

    # Replaces:
        - Greater than operators ('>') with 'NOT BETWEEN 0 AND #'
        - Equals operators ('=') with 'BETWEEN # AND #'
        - OR operators ('OR') with its symbolic contrapart ('||')
        - AND operators ('AND') with its symbolic contrapart ('&&')


    # Doubles:
            Server-side, the following sub-strings "s" will be identified in the middle of our full string
            "s[:l]+s+[l:]" with 1<l<length(s). The process does not run recursively, as shown by local tests, the middle "LIKE"
            will be removed, thus leaving behind a normal "s" query.

        - Pattern Matching operators ('LIKE') as ('LILIKEKE')
        - Selection operators ('SELECT') as ('SELSELECTECT')
        - Commenting operators ('--') as ('-=-')
            > Here, we modify the string with a character we know will be removed by the sanitization process
        - Boolean operators ('TRUE') and ('FALSE') as ('TRTRUEUE') and ('FALFALSE')
        - Negation operators ('NOT') as ('NONOTT')


    # Simply removes if are detected:
            There is no known way to effectively replace this element in all cases

        - Arguments separation operators (',')
